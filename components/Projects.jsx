            "A developer-focused collaborative blogging platform inspired by dev.to, supporting technical writing with a Markdown editor and social features. The platform includes user authentication using JWT and Google OAuth, enabling secure and frictionless sign-ins. I designed features such as public user profiles, threaded comments, and real-time updates powered by Supabase. To enhance discoverability and engagement, I implemented search functionality, trending feeds, image uploads, and SEO-optimized post structures.",

            "A productivity app to help users stay on top of their tasks with reminders, subtasks, and a calendar-based view that tracks progress over time. I handled the backend using Express and PostgreSQL, setting up REST APIs to manage tasks and user data. To keep things smooth and informative, I added a paginated dashboard with weekly summaries and insights. The UI is fully responsive and supports dark/light mode, built with React and Tailwind CSS, with modals for quick task creation and edits.",
